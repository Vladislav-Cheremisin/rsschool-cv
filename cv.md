# Vladislav Cheremisin
### *Junior FrontEnd developer* (I hope I will be soon)

Hello, thank you for reading my CV. My name is Vladislav, I am Male 22 years old.

I live in Russian Federation, Ryazan. I want to find job as FrontEnd developer, because this work is really interesting for me.

I already have some HTML CSS skills and a little bit JS (I'm improving all my skills in RSSchools at the moment).

**My best qualities are:**
* Reliable
* Energetic
* Purposeful
* Hardworking
* Motivated
* Friendly

**My worst qualities:**
* Talkative (a little bit)
* Stubborn

## Education:

* I completed Ryazan State University in 2019 (Department of History and International relations).
* Language courses for one year. English level - A2 Pre-intermediate (Online tests says what my English level is B1, but I don't think so).

## Experience:
Few very simple layouts (HTML + CSS only), one for example: [Layout](images/Layout-example.jpg) | [Website](http://xn--62-6kci4clbaajmjidf.xn--p1ai/) (I am not proud of this work, because I already know how to do better, so i'll change information in this part a little bit later).

## Code example: 
```

const factorial = (n) => {
  let result = n;
  if (n > 12 || n < 0) {
    throw new RangeError(`Number must be in range from ${0} to ${12} :)`);
  } else if (n === 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    for ( let i = (n - 1); i > 0; i -= 1) {
      result = result * i;
  }
  }
  return result;
}

// I will update this part when I will be able to write better code.
```
